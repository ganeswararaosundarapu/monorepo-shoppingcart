## Internationalization i18n
  This project supports Internationalization for few locale languages for time being.

  `yarn generate-messages:all` - generates the supported local files with default english message content. You'll still need to update the translations manually in your json files, but now you know what messages you still need to update.

  `yarn generate-messages:en` - generates all messages as english locale (default locale)
